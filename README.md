# FormalDinnerApp
# Jess and Kenzie
This is an xcode app for formal dinner assignments.
Jess and Kenzie worked with Grace Davidson and Youtube videos to make this app.
We put our csv file of students and their assignments into JSON format so that we could retrieve the information from a local host.
We displayed this information in a numerical list that is also organized by assignment in xcode storyboard.
When using the app, you can look at the entire list of students and their assignments or you can search your name, a table number, or a specific assignment.

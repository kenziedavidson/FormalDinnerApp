# FormalDinnerApp
#Jess and Kenzie used youtube videos and Grace Davidson to complete this project


xcode app for formal dinner assignments Jess and I worked with my mom to make this app 
We put our csv file of students and their assignments into JSON format so that we could retrieve the information from a local host 
We displayed this information in a numerical list that is also organized by assignment in xcode storyboard 
When using the app, you can look at the entire list of students and their assignments or you can search your name, a table number, or a specific assignment
